Reflection Prompts

1. Awareness Prompts

“What brings you here right now?”
“Is this visit intentional or a quick drift?”
“Take a moment — what’s your focus right now?”
“What’s happening for you at this moment?
“Are you taking a break or escaping a task?”
“Do you want to continue or refocus?”

2. Energy & Emotion Check-Ins

“How are you feeling right now?”
“Are you tired, bored, or looking for a break?”
“What’s your energy like right now?”
“Do you need rest or stimulation?”

3. Goal Reminders (Soft)

“Anything you wanted to finish before this?”
“Is this aligned with your plan for today?”
“Would a short reset help more right now?”
“What’s one thing you want to get done next?”

4. Behavioural Reflection

“Is this the right moment for this site?”
“Are you choosing this, or did it just happen?”
“What do you want to do after this break?”

5. Commitment Light

“How long do you plan to stay here?”
“What’s your intention for this visit?”
